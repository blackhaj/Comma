# Comma
A personal finance dashboard

## Features to complete
* Nested routes e.g. accounts/1/balances (can make it CRUD too)
* Images and icons in React with Webpack
* Finish the main pages of content
* Manage sessions on the back end?
* Proper route handling with logged in people - currently done with a Boolean - not ideal
* Fetch the data and populate asychronously
* Managing state and doing so in conjunction with the DB
* Web app view (as opposed to mobile view)

## Weaknesses and new topics identified
* React lifecycle
* Hooks
* Functional v class components (how do you tie logic to functional components like you do with methods on classes)
* State/DB
* Fetch requests and rendering (currently requests work but page populated before)
