## Contributing
I would love for you to try out the app and submit any issues you encounter. Feel free to fork to your own repo and submit PRs. Some features I would like to add:
1. Utilize external balance APIs such as Bud or Truelayer
2. Better security
3. More detailed but dynamic (hence scalable) account insights
